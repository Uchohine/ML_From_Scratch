# ML_From_Scratch

This is a repo where you can find complete machine learning algorithm implementations with the best/all optimizations I find or sklearn used (almost) from scratch.

## Current finished algorithm:

1. decision tree
2. adaboost
3. gradient boost
4. xgboost (without paralleling and pruning)
5. SVC with kernels (using cvxopt - a quadprog optimizatiion tool)
6. SVR with kernels (using cvxopt)
7. KNN (Ball tree, KD tree, LSH, brute force)

## Planning on:
1. linear regression
2. k means
3. logistic regression
4. neural network
5. convolution network
6. all kinds of optimizers (yes, I will do deep learning algorithms too)
7. bag (random forest etc.)
8. More to find out...

### If you want any particular algorithm that is not listed here, I am happy to learn all about. Please email me at wxm1210@bu.edu, with at least the name of the algorithm, and link of the paper if you can.
